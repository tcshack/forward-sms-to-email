## Forward SMS To Email
In this app, we implement a basic functionality to allow the system to forward specific messages when they arrived.

Intructions

1- Make sure you compile the Constants file in the source code, by inserting appropriate username, email address and password.
2- When ran the app, input your settings to be sure you receive SMS the next time it arrives, only if the message sender phone number matches the one you configured in the app.
3- When the message sender phone number matches with your settings, one action can occur at a time.
3.1- If the message body matches your secret key, Wi-Fi is enabled (only on Android devices having API 26 and lower)
3.2- If the message body is other thing than the secret key, it is forwarded to the email address you specified in the Constants file in the source code.

# Thanks for using the app.
